It results in generation of collimated quasi-monoenergetic proton bunch of high energy (yellow). The bunch can be also recognized in the proton energy spectra near the end of the simulation."

      "description": "Electrons accelerated from a thin foil irradiated by an ultra-intense laser pulse emit energetic photons in the gamma region. The pulse rips electrons out of the initially solid target into the free space in front of it. While the laser pulse still burns through the target, the fast electrons interact with its strong electromagnetic field, producing energetic photons through the process of quantum radiation reaction - a peculiar kind of self-force stemming from higher-order corrections to the Lorentz force only observable in the presence of extremely strong electromagnetic fields, such as those of produced by the ELI lasers."

      "description": "Plasma represents the most diffuse state of matter in the Universe, from the inside of our Sun to the structures that orbit around black holes. The dynamic of the plasma is strongly connected with the dynamic of the engaged magnetic field, such as you cannot fully understand the former without understanding the latter. Here, you can experience the evolution of the magnetic field, represented by these filaments. Instabilities grow inside the plasma (not shown) to modify the shape and the strength of the magnetic field. Something arises from what was uniform and ordinate once: Turbulence"

      "description": "This simulation represents intense laser beam focused on the rear side of the plasma target. Plasma is made of two types of particles - electrons and protons. In particle-in-cell simulations, we use macro-particles, where 1 macro-particle represents many real particles. Here you can see only electrons, protons are not interesting in this case since their weight is much higher (and therefore they do not move). Behind the laser pulse, plasma waves are excited (density spikes moving with the group velocity of the laser beam). Under certain conditions, electrons may be trapped inside the wave and accelerated (this is called laser-wakefield acceleration - LWFA)."
